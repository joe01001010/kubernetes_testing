# kubernetes_testing
This repo is for testing kubenetes and also container building primarily using minikube

Got the helm working for the deployment but having more issues because the ansible execution environment is designed
to complete as soon as it starts and not be a long running process. Going to have to potentiall rebuild the container image.
